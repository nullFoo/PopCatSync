# PopCatSync
 Makes a PopCat that syncs to songs you add in the playlist


## how to use
Step 1. install Python 3.9 (3.10 will probably work too)
Step 2. open a command prompt window
Step 3. run `cd [path to folder]`
Step 4. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you're on mac, or `py -m pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` if you are on windows
Step 5. double click "main.py"

To close it, close the python window, not the window where the cat is, because this will not work as the cat is immortal and does not bow to mere mortal close buttons
