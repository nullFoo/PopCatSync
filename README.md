# PopCatSync
 Makes a PopCat that syncs to songs you add in the playlist


## how to use
Step 1. install Python 3.9 (3.10 will probably work too)

Step 2. open a command prompt window

Step 3. run `cd [path to folder]`

Step 4. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you're on mac, or `py -m pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt` if you are on windows

Step 5. add any songs you want to the `songs` folder

Step 6. double click "main.py"

Step 7. wait for it to load the songs (can take a long time depending on how many songs there are)

Step 8. pop pop pop pop pop


To close it, close the python window, not the window where the cat is, because this will not work as the cat is immortal and does not bow to mere mortal close buttons
